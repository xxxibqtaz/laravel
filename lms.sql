This is used to fetch global data about the Coronavirus outbreak.\r\n\r\n- Api keys & access tokens: what they are and how to use them.\r\n\r\n- REST Client: a VSCode extension that you can use to send HTTP requests and view the response directly in VS Code.\r\n\r\n- Design a REST API service using the Dart http package.\r\n\r\n- Make requests and parse the JSON response data into strongly-typed model classes.\r\n\r\n- Build a dashboard UI with nice-looking cards that show the data from the API.\r\n\r\n- Combine multiple API requests into a single response by using futures.\r\n\r\n- Use a RefreshIndicator to get updated data from the API.\r\n\r\n- Error handling, and how to show alert dialogs to the user.\r\n\r\n- Data caching with Shared Preferences, so that the data is saved on device for offline use.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, you will learn about good app architecture as a way to structure our code and keep it modular.\r\n\r\nThis course is all about mastering the basics. It covers many important topics, with attention to detail, and emphasis on how to write a production-ready app.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to build Flutter apps that connect with any other REST API that you want to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse organization\r\n\r\nThe course follows a linear structure, and shows how to build a fully functional application from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe content is divided into multiple sections, each covering a specific topic in detail.\r\n\r\nFull source code is provided for each lesson, and the entire project is available on GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPremium Support\r\n\r\nBeyond all the video content, premium support is included, so that you can ask questions if you get stuck. I\'ll do my best to answer all questions within 24 hours - but please keep them relevant to the course material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n\r\nThis course is NOT for absolute beginners.\r\n\r\n- You should already be familiar with the Dart Language. If you are not, you can follow my introduction to Dart, which is available for free on my YouTube channel.\r\n\r\n- You should already have Flutter installed on your system, and Visual Studio Code or Android Studio configured for Flutter development.\r\n\r\n- You should already have some knowledge of the most common Flutter widgets, and understand the difference between stateful and stateless widgets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeaching style\r\n\r\nThis is a fast-paced crash course. We will build a full application from scratch, but I will not explain every single step in detail. Instead, I will focus on the most important concepts, and always explain what we\'re going to build and why, and then how to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnroll Today\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn how to build maintainable Flutter apps using REST APIs, and become a better software engineer, then this course is for you.\r\n\r\nI\'m very excited to share this course with you, so enroll now to get started.', 1, 0),

Retention rate is incredible because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5\" - Muhammad Ibrahim\r\n\r\n\"Angela is a spectacular teacher!\" - Marco Zanirato\r\n\r\n\"This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I realized how good this course was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept.\" - Marc\r\n\r\n\"Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but Angela made me a pro in weeks.\" - Burak Tunçbilek\r\n\r\n\"IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of this course is built to make you learn, not just watch and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you.

Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:\r\n\r\nI have revamped my expectation for what a 5 star course should be for Udemy. Angela, you\'re awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela! - Alberto L\r\n\r\n\"I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, deep and clear.\" - Žan Fras\r\n\r\n\"I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the best explanation on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable.\" - Bryan Pukanda\r\n\r\n\"I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which i did not want it to end.

They show all the ways of using Xcode and other services that took me months to learn willy nilly. Wish I had this course a year ago but even with a year of Swift experience I still found a lot of great information and helpful tips. Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I\'m always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills. Angela is a wonderful speaker and should do the voiceovers on everyone\'s instructional videos, seriously. :)\" - Marcy Vernon\r\n\r\n\"Def. an amazing and awesome class for learning iOS programming.

I am going to teach you the art and science of retargeting so you can have a chance to convert the vast majority of your visitors that simply weren\'t ready to convert on their first visit. \r\n\r\nRetargeting is the most effective way to bring those users back (through your actual, live retargeting ad campaigns), at the precise time that they\'re ready to convert. \r\n\r\nI\'m going to explain exactly how retargeting works from a technological perspective, and I\'m going to show you how the technology has matured and advanced through the years. Simply put, retargeting is accomplished through dropping cookies on your visitors\' browsers which allows your retargeting platform to follow that user around the internet. \r\n\r\nCookies are dropped on your visitors\' browser through a little piece of code that you put on your site, often referred to as a pixel. If you\'re remarketing with AdWords, then AdWords is going to supply the pixel for you to place on your site. If you\'re remarketing with Adroll, then Adroll will supply their cookie for you to place on their site. \r\n\r\nAll this talk of cookies, pixels and tracking codes may sound complex, but in fact it\'s really easy to learn once you get the hang of it. The technology isn\'t the important part of this course .... what I teach you about understanding your customers psychologically and how to actually configure, develop and optimize profitable retargeting campaigns is where the true value lies.\r\n\r\nRetargeting remains one of the most effective forms of online advertising, and it\'s used by your competitors to convert the majority of their traffic. Experts predict that within the next few years, most if not all display ads inventory on the web will be remarketing and retargeting ads. \r\n\r\nRetargeting is so effective because it helps you stay in the forefront of your customers\' minds and enables you to bring them back to your website when they\'re actually ready to convert. Every time your customer engages with one of your retargeted ads, you increase your brand recognition and make it all the more likely that that shopper will eventually become a customer of yours.\r\n\r\nRetargeting campaigns typically see much higher click through rates and conversion rates than traditional search and display campaigns, which further illustrates how important it is that you have the knowledge and skills to develop your own successful remarketing and retargeting campaigns.\r\n\r\nUsing Google AdWords Remarketing campaigns, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and more, I will teach you step by step how to finally get the maximum value out of your website visitors with highly successful retargeting campaigns.\r\n\r\nFor much less than the price of one dinner out with the family, you\'re going to get over 10 hours of video lectures, access to our student discussion forum, and the ability to ask me any questions you may have as you progress through the course. \r\n\r\nOn top of all that, you get lifetime access and a 30 day, 100% money back guarantee!\r\n\r\nZERO Experience Required\r\n\r\nIn this course you will learn:\r\n\r\nWhat retargeting and how does it work? \r\nWhat are remarketing campaigns in Google AdWords?\r\nThe technology behind retargeting and how \"follow-me\" ads actually get served\r\nThe history of ad exchanges and ad networks\r\nHow to look at your website visitors from a psychological perspective \r\nHow to plan and develop your remarketing lists\r\nThe concepts of the buyers funnel and how to determine where in the funnel your visitors are \r\nThe concept of engagement and how to use intent signals to your advantage\r\nHow to use Google Tag Manager to track advanced audience segments like scroll depth tracking and on-site session timers\r\nHow to deploy your tags and variables through Google Tag Manager \r\nHow to use Google Analytics to track the most important metrics and data\r\nHow to set up, optimize and manage your remarketing campaigns inside Google AdWords\r\n... and much, much more!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for? \r\n\r\nClick the \"take this course\" button now, or feel free to preview some of the lecture below. \r\n\r\nEither way, I really appreciate you taking the time to check out this course, and I can\'t wait to see you in a couple minutes on the other side! \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nIsaac ', 1, 0),

Welcome to The Business Intelligence Analyst Course, the only course you need to become a BI Analyst. \r\n\r\nWe are proud to present you this one-of-a-kind opportunity. There are several online courses teaching some of the skills related to the BI Analyst profession. The truth of the matter is that none of them completely prepare you.\r\n\r\nOur program is different than the rest of the materials available online.  \r\n\r\nIt is truly comprehensive. The Business Intelligence Analyst Course comprises of several modules:  \r\n\r\nIntroduction to Data and Data Science  \r\n\r\nStatistics and Excel  \r\n\r\nDatabase theory  \r\n\r\nSQL  \r\n\r\nTableau  \r\n\r\nSQL + Tableau  \r\n\r\nThese are the precise technical skills recruiters are looking for when hiring BI Analysts. And today, you have the chance of acquiring an invaluable advantage to get ahead of other candidates. This course will be the secret to your success. And your success is our success, so let’s make it happen!  \r\n\r\nHere are some more details of what you get with The Business Intelligence Analyst Course:   \r\n\r\nIntroduction to Data and Data Science – Make sense of terms like business intelligence, traditional and big data, traditional statistical methods, machine learning, predictive analytics, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and many more;  \r\n\r\nStatistics and Excel – Understand statistical testing and build a solid foundation. Modern software packages and programming languages are automating most of these activities, but this part of the course gives you something more valuable – critical thinking abilities;  \r\n\r\nDatabase theory – Before you start using SQL, it is highly beneficial to learn about the underlying database theory and acquire an understanding of why databases are created and how they can help us manage data  \r\n\r\nSQL - when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business  \r\n\r\nTableau – one of the most powerful and intuitive data visualization tools available out there. Almost all large companies use such tools to enhance their BI capabilities. Tableau is the #1 best-in-class solution that helps you create powerful charts and dashboards  \r\n\r\nLearning a programming language is meaningless without putting it to use. That’s why we integrate SQL and Tableau, and perform several real-life Business Intelligence tasks  \r\n\r\nSounds amazing, right?  \r\n\r\nOur courses are unique because our team works hard to:  \r\n\r\nPre-script the entire content  \r\n\r\nWork with real-life examples  \r\n\r\nProvide easy to understand and complete explanations  \r\n\r\nCreate beautiful and engaging animations  \r\n\r\nPrepare exercises, course notes, quizzes, and other materials that will enhance your course taking experience  \r\n\r\nBe there for you and provide support whenever necessary  \r\n\r\nWe love teaching and we are really excited about this journey.
